Hi! My name is Víctor Domene Martínez and I'm a Biomedical Engineering student at UPF (Barcelona). 
In this repository I'm sharing a code-generated painting. So basically, this code could be used as the base to any abstract image you may want to generate with some code. Despite here being used concentric circles and certain colors, the idea is that anybody can use this as a temblate to play a little bit with code-generated painting.
